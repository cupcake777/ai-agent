"""Tell the chat how an exec-approval prompt ended when the chat itself did not answer it.

``tools.approval_gateway_wait._await_gateway_decision`` calls the settle hook once the wait ends.
Only the TUI registered such a hook, so on Telegram / Slack / WhatsApp a card kept live buttons
after its timer ran out — and after another surface (a desktop approval plugin calling
``resolve_gateway_approval(source=...)``) answered it — and the user never learned what happened.
The turn runner registers the hook here right after the prompt was delivered.

Best-effort by design: a failed notice is logged at debug — the approval already resolved as
"no", and nothing here may block the agent thread.
